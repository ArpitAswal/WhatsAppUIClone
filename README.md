WhatsAppUIClone is a mobile application that replicates the user interface of an earlier version of WhatsApp, focusing on the classic design elements that users are familiar with. The app includes a seamless phone number verification process, mimicking the original WhatsApp login experience. Once authenticated, users can navigate through the main screens, such as the ChatsScreen, StatusScreen, and CallsScreen, via a traditional TabView layout.

The ChatsScreen displays a list of recent conversations, with profile pictures, names, and the last message preview, following WhatsApp's signature style. The StatusScreen allows users to view the status updates of their contacts, and view both recent and viewed status, and the CallsScreen lists recent call history, including missed, received, and outgoing calls.

Additional screens include the All Saved Contacts Screen, where users can view a list of their saved contacts and initiate conversations. The ChatMessages Screen provides an in-depth chat experience, where users can exchange text, voice notes, and media, adhering to the familiar WhatsApp message bubble style.

An important design feature followed in this clone is the inclusion of the community creation tab, which WhatsApp introduced later. This feature allows users to create communities, offering a dedicated section in the TabView, where users can manage and participate in group chats seamlessly, with intuitive navigation that mirrors the experience in the original app's version at that time.

This project pays homage to WhatsApp's classic design while incorporating all the core functionalities that users expect in a messaging app. It focuses on a clean UI, efficient navigation, and a familiar, user-friendly layout.
